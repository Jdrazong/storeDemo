# Store demo

Store demo built with react/redux and a simple nodejs server to create mock responses.

## Getting Started

In the root folder of the application in the console terminal type 'npm run dev' => this will start node server serving the application on 'localhost:3000'

### Prerequisites

Requires node version 8

### Installing

## Running the tests

In the root folder of the application in the console terminal type 'npm run test'

!! tests don't work on mac, not sure why because I don't have one to resolve the issue, just asked a friend to test if the app works on mac in general,
the application starts but running tests throws an error
